// LECTURE: Values and Variables
// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
// assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
// 2. Log their values to the console

// let country = 'England';
// let continent = 'Europe';
// let population = '56 Million';
// console.log(country, continent, population)

// LECTURE: Data Types
// 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
// country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
// 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
// 2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
// to the console

// let isIsland = true;
// let language = '';
// console.log(isIsland, population, country, language);

// LECTURE: Basic Operators
// 1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
// then how many people would live in each half?
// 2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
// 3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
// Finland?
// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
// have less people than the average country?
// 5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
// which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
// people speak portuguese'

let country = 'England';
let continent = 'Europe';
let population = 56000000;

population = population / 2;

console.log(population += 1)

population = 56000000
let finlandPopulation = 6000000;
console.log(population > finlandPopulation)

let averagePopulation = 33000000
console.log(population > averagePopulation)

let description = 'Portugal is in Europe, its 11 million people speak portuguese'
console.log(description)
